ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sona Altun.

ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in .Net Core Technologies and constantly improving my skills in this area.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning specifically about MVC, Entity Framework Core, and ASP.NET Core among other .Net Core technologies.

ðŸ“« If you want to reach out to me, you can contact me via my email address.

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy coding with a cup of coffee, and my best ideas usually come with caffeine!
